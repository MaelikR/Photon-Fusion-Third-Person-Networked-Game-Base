Detailed Explanation of ThirdPersonController.cs

The ThirdPersonController.cs script is a comprehensive player controller for a third-person character in a networked game, using Photon Fusion for networking, Unity's Input System, and Cinemachine for camera control. Below is a detailed explanation of the core functionalities of this script.

Purpose
This script manages the movement, animation, camera control, and networking functionality for a third-person character in a multiplayer environment. It handles player input, movement physics, gravity, jumping, and proper synchronization with Photon Fusion's networking.

Key Features
Network Synchronization:

The class inherits from NetworkBehaviour from Fusion, allowing seamless integration with Photon Fusion's network synchronization. The HasInputAuthority check ensures that only the player who owns the character can control it.
Player Movement:

The player has adjustable parameters for movement speed (MoveSpeed and SprintSpeed), jump height (JumpHeight), and gravity (Gravity), allowing for flexible control over the character's movement physics.
Movement is handled through a CharacterController component and is affected by input from Unity's Input System (StarterAssetsInputs).
Camera Integration:

Utilizes Cinemachine's CinemachineFreeLook and CinemachineBrain to provide smooth and responsive third-person camera control that follows and looks at the player.
The camera automatically follows the local player, ensuring a proper view of the character's movements and actions.
Animation Handling:

Uses an Animator component to manage character animations. Animation parameters such as Speed, Jump, FreeFall, Grounded, and MotionSpeed are defined, allowing smooth transitions between different animation states based on the player’s movement and actions.
Grounded Check:

The script checks whether the character is grounded using a sphere check at the feet of the character. This ensures accurate detection of whether the player is on the ground or airborne, which is essential for applying gravity, jumping, and other physics.
Jump and Gravity Management:

The script handles jumping and gravity, allowing the player to jump if grounded and applying gravity to simulate falling when in the air. The JumpTimeout and FallTimeout help manage the timing and smoothness of these actions.
Networking Functionality:

The FixedUpdateNetwork() method ensures that the player’s movement, animations, and actions are synchronized across the network, allowing smooth multiplayer interaction.
The script supports taking damage with the TakeDamage(float damage, GameObject attacker) method, which reduces player health and handles death through Fusion's Runner.Despawn(Object) method.
Detailed Breakdown of Core Methods
Awake() Method:

Initializes essential components such as CinemachineFreeLook, CinemachineBrain, PlayerInput, StarterAssetsInputs, and CharacterController.
Ensures that all necessary components are attached and properly configured, logging errors if any are missing.
Start() Method:

Assigns animation IDs for efficient reference within the script.
Sets up the appropriate camera and input authority configurations based on whether the player is local or remote using the OnStartAuthority() and OnStopAuthority() methods.
OnStartAuthority() and OnStopAuthority():

OnStartAuthority(): Enables the camera, input, and other components for the local player.
OnStopAuthority(): Disables components that are not needed for remote players, optimizing performance.
FixedUpdateNetwork() Method:

This method, executed in each network tick, handles gravity, jumping, grounded checks, and movement for the local player.
GroundedCheck() Method:

Uses Physics.CheckSphere() to detect if the player is grounded, ensuring accurate physics interactions.
JumpAndGravity() Method:

Applies gravity and jump physics, managing the player's vertical velocity, and updating jump-related animation states.
Move() Method:

Handles player movement based on input, adjusting speed, rotation, and animations accordingly.

Uses the CharacterController to move the player character in a smooth and responsive manner, taking the camera's direction into account.

Integration with Other Components

Input System: The script interfaces with StarterAssetsInputs to receive player input, allowing movement, jumping, and sprinting based on keyboard/controller inputs.

Animator: Manages animation states to ensure the character responds appropriately to different actions such as moving, jumping, and falling.

Cinemachine Camera: Integrates with CinemachineFreeLook to provide an intuitive camera experience that follows the player in a third-person view.

Key Attributes and Variables

MoveSpeed and SprintSpeed: Control how fast the character moves.

JumpHeight: Defines how high the character can jump.

Gravity: Controls the rate at which the character falls.

GroundLayers: Defines which layers the player can interact with for grounded checks.

RotationSmoothTime: Determines how quickly the character rotates to face the movement direction.
Networking Integration

This script makes extensive use of Fusion's NetworkBehaviour features to ensure all player actions and states are properly synchronized across the network.
By using HasInputAuthority, the script differentiates between local and remote players, ensuring that each player can only control their own character.
